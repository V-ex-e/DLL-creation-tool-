# DLL-creation-tool-

Works better on KDE plasma for the necessary rice â„¢; we all love and share ^^.

Work in meintained progress (WIMP):

Main functionality: 

DLL creation
> dll creation with mnsfvenom (Unix/Debian) dpkg
> dll obfuscation with XOR encryption
> syntax obfuscation and randomization
> avoidance of sandboxing

Executable modification
> user defines a custom executable
> executable will be decompiled
> script attaches Dll to .exe with a PE loader
> DLL and EXE are obfuscated

Custom Settings
> user defines a dll to be created with streamlined menu
> user can use a prebuild dll
> user defines ports and IPs of target and attacker machine
> user can use a built EXE or define one to be recompiled and encrypted
> Dll rootkit loading and permission extension
